The speed, competition, and crashes (less so now that I am actually racing now too, yup, definitely not a fan of crashes anymore).\nEver since then, I carried with that my love for anything that has 4 wheels, you know, that also doesn\u0026rsquo;t break down if you push it to its limits. I played a lot of racing games, NFS, Burnout, Grid, Asphalt on mobile, and Real Racing.\n\u0026ldquo;Okay okay, we get the point! You love racing.\u0026rdquo; # Yes, but that is not the point. you would think of racing as this EXTREME sport, with the AGGRESSIVE action-packed visuals and music and all that flare!\nNo, that is not the spirit of racing.\nRacing is NOT what it seems # Racing is quite literally, an art, beneath those gnarly crashes, strong visuals, motion blur, there is a space all racers share, a state of discipline, consistency, and elegance.\nWhy? Because mistakes are going to hurt you very, very hard. Your competitors won\u0026rsquo;t wait for you if you crash, a single incident could literally decide the outcome between win or lose, sometimes even, life or death.\nTo me, racing is DevOps # “When I look fast, I’m not smooth and I am going slowly. And when I look slow, I am smooth and going fast.” — Alain Prost This is going to be a bit technical, if you know race driving, or if you know DevOps, then you won\u0026rsquo;t feel lost.\nThere is the apex, the perfect window to execute an action. There is a pit stop, a routine maintenance needed to help us finish. There is the need for winning, but you also need to be reliable. There is tyre management, but pushing too hard could come with consequences later on. There is race telemetry, data that guides decision-making and prevents surprises. There is the driver\u0026rsquo;s margin for error, where you need to balance where you can or can not make a mistake. Garage61 and Grafana telemetries, side by side DevOps and racing can be equivalents at its core, both requiring controlled mistakes, preferrably no mistakes at all but we know it\u0026rsquo;s impossible. A whole team, a whole system could fail at any point in time, anywhere.\nThe way you handle these mistakes is going to help you achieve a P1 (position 1, essentially a race win) or a product/service that essentially makes your customers happy.\nThat is why we make playbooks, strategies, team coordination, rapid feedback loops, and continuous improvement (spoiler alert).\nThese two share one mantra: that hope is not a strategy. # Intricate playbooks, backups, contingency plans, discipline, commitment, focus, and consistency are the hard requirements in order to succeed in these two, not being rash, indecisive, inelegant, or unstable.\nI love both of them # That is one thing you can trust about me, on track, or in front of a terraform config, it is where I feel most at home. With that, I found someone I share my thoughts with while I was writing this article.\n“DevOps is like auto racing…” — Chris Short, Red Hat Developers # Feature Image by: BLACK FALCON\n","date":"4 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/1756998969397-racing-lines-and-deployment-pipelines/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThere is only one thing you should learn about me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch1 class=\"relative group\"\u003eOkay, maybe 2 things \n    \u003cdiv id=\"okay-maybe-2-things\" class=\"anchor\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \u003cspan\n        class=\"absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 ltr:-left-6 rtl:-right-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100 select-none\"\u003e\n        \u003ca class=\"group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700 !no-underline\" href=\"#okay-maybe-2-things\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\n    \u003c/span\u003e        \n    \n\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEver since my big brother Noel introduced me to Formula 1 on our old Sharp CRT TV, I fell in love with it.
